## Project - Retail Store Management System

Welcome to the Retail Store Management System ðŸ›’
This hands-on project will help you apply everything you've learned in the Learn SQL course to build and manage a real-world database for a retail business.

Imagine you are a database administrator for a local retail store. Your job is to design, create, and manage a database that stores information about products, customers, and orders. You will use SQL queries to handle tasks like:

- âœ… Creating and modifying tables
- âœ… Adding, updating, and deleting records
- âœ… Filtering and sorting data for better insights
- âœ… Using aggregations to analyze store performance
- âœ… Working with dates to track sales trends

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional database that mimics a real-world retail system. You'll also strengthen your problem-solving skills by debugging and optimizing queries.
